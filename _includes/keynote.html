                                <p>Recent years have seen great advances in using machine-learned ranking functions for relevance prediction. Any learning-to-rank framework requires abundant labeled training examples. In web search, labels may either be assigned explicitly (say, through crowd-sourced assessors) or based on implicit user feedback (say, result clicks). In personal (e.g. email) search, obtaining labels is more difficult: document-query pairs cannot be given to assessors due to privacy constraints, and clicks on query-document pairs are extremely sparse (since each user has a separate corpus), noisy and biased. Over the past several years, we have worked on techniques for training ranking functions on result clicks in an unbiased and scalable fashion. Our techniques are used in many Google products, such as Gmail, Inbox, Drive and Calendar. In this talk, I will present an overview of this line of research. </p>
