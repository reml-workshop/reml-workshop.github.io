					<p>Submissions must be in English, in PDF format, and in the current ACM two-column conference format. Suitable LaTeX, Word, and Overleaf templates are available from the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">ACM Website</a> (use “sigconf” proceedings template for LaTeX and the Interim Template for Word). Submissions may consist of <b>up to 6 pages of content, plus unrestricted space for appendices and references</b>. The papers can represent reports of original research or preliminary research results. The review process is <b>double-blind</b>. Authors are required to take all reasonable steps to preserve the anonymity of their submission. The submission must not include author information and must not include citations or discussion of related work that would make the authorship apparent. However, it is acceptable to refer to companies or organizations that provided datasets, hosted experiments or deployed solutions if there is no implication that the authors are currently affiliated with these organizations. Papers will be evaluated according to their significance, originality, technical content, style, clarity, relevance to the workshop, and likelihood of generating discussion. Authors should note that changes to the author list after the submission deadline are not allowed. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for, attend , and present the work at the workshop (either in person or remotely). All papers are to be submitted via <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=reml2023">EasyChair</a>.</p>
					    
					<p>Papers presented at the workshop will be required to be uploaded to arXiv.org after the acceptance notification, but will be considered <b>non-archival</b>, and may be submitted elsewhere (modified or not), although the workshop site will maintain a link to the arXiv versions. Therefore, articles being under consideration by other venues as long as they are within the submission policy of the other venues can be submitted to REML. This makes the workshop a forum for the presentation and discussion of current work, without preventing the work from being published elsewhere.</p>
