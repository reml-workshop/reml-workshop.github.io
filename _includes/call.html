								<p>We invite two kinds of contributions: <b>research papers</b> (up to 6 pages) and <b>position papers</b> (up to 2 pages). Submissions must be in English, in PDF format, and should not exceed the appropriate page limit in the current ACM two-column conference format (including references and figures). Suitable LaTeX and Word templates are available from the <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template" target="\_blank">ACM Website</a>. The papers can represent reports of original research, preliminary research results, or proposals for new work. The review process is single-blind.  Papers will be evaluated according to their significance, originality, technical content, style, clarity, relevance to the workshop, and likelihood of generating discussion. Authors should note that changes to the author list after the submission deadline are not allowed without permission from the PC Chairs.  At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for, attend, and present the work at the workshop. All short papers are to be submitted via EasyChair at <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lnd4ir" target="\_blank">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lnd4ir</a>.</p>

<p>Papers presented at the workshop will be required to be uploaded to arXiv.org but will be considered non-archival, and may be submitted elsewhere (modified or not), although the workshop site will maintain a link to the arXiv versions. This makes the workshop a forum for the presentation and discussion of current work, without preventing the work from being published elsewhere.</p>
